# easysite

I created this project in the attempt to make it as easy as possible to create a website, subject to the following restrictions:

- You want to use Github to serve your site.
- You either don't know how to use Git or don't want to use Git.
- You want full control over the CSS and the design of your site.

Rather than explaining the directions here, I'm going to practice dogfooding, and send you over to [the website for this repo](https://bachmeil.github.io/easysite/), which was created using easysite.
