# easysite

I created this project in the attempt to make it as easy as possible to create a website, subject to the following restrictions:

- You want to use Github to serve your site.
- You either don't know how to use Git or don't want to use Git.
- You want full control over the CSS and the design of your site.

Rather than explaining the directions here, I'm going to practice dogfooding, and send you over to [the website for this repo](https://bachmeil.github.io/easysite/), which was created using easysite.

You can view [an example easysite website here](https://github.com/bachmeil/exsite).

**Update:** I created a generic version found in `index-generic.html`. That can be used with Netlify or on your own server.

To use with Netlify:

- Download `index-generic.html` to an empty directory on your hard drive.
- Change the name to `index.html`.
- Add markdown files as desired.
- Copy the directory to Netlify to deploy.

To use with your own server:

- Do the same steps as for Netlify, but copy the directory to your server rather than deploying to Netlify.
